## AKA exporter

To get the recent URLs registered to AKA, open the latest artifact [for this action](https://github.com/unoplatform/aka.tools/actions/workflows/aka-exporter.yml).

Additional notes:
- It runs automatically every 6 hours
- The [action](https://github.com/unoplatform/aka.tools/actions/workflows/aka-exporter.yml) in place can be triggered manually as needed, you just need to re-run the latest build
